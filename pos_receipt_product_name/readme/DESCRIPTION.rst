This module provides the following functions:

* Add a field called 'POS Product Name' to keep the product names presentable on POS receipt printed through PosBox. (As of 26 Oct 2014, PosBox does not handle double-byte Japanese characters) 
* This module only handles the part that adds a field in product; receipt design is updated separately

This module depends on ``point_of_sale`` module.
